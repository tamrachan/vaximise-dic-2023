# Vaximise
With two friends, I entered the University of Cambridgeâ€™s Davidson Inventors Challenge in 2023. Our project, called "Vaximise", aimed to achieve vaccine equity by developing a medical database system, focusing on the
United Nations' 'Good Health and Wellbeing' sustainability goal. I contributed a Graphical User Interface
database using Python and Tkinter. Working in a team developed my communication, collaboration, and
leadership skills, and we achieved the respectable score of 9/10 in every section.
